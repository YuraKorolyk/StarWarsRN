# App review invitation

Thank you for choosing to review my app! I appreciate your feedback on the code, design, and overall implementation.

I have followed the requirements, but decided to use the GraphQL API following the links you provided.

The instructions for launching the application are described below:
## Step 1: Download modules 

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```
## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
